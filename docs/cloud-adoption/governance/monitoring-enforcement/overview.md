# Fusion: What is monitoring and enforcement in relation to cloud governance?

The five disciplines of Cloud Governance

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Monitoring and Enforcement is defined as one of the five disciplines of Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies to 


govern asset configuration or deployment. Within the five disciplines of Cloud Governance, configuration governance includes deployment, configuration alignment, and high availability/disaster recovery (HA/DR) strategies. This could be through manual activities or fully automated DevOps activities. In either case, the policies would remain largely the same.

This article outlines the Configuration Management process that a company experiences during the planning, building, adopting, and operating phases of implementing a cloud solution. It's impossible for any one document to account for all of the requirements of any business. As such, each section of this article outlines suggested minimum and potential activities. The objective of these activities is to help you build a [Policy MVP](../policy-compliance/overview.md#policy-minimally-viable-product-mvp), but establish a framework for [Incremental Policy](../policy-compliance/overview.md) evolution. The Cloud Governance Team should decide how much to invest in these activities to improve the  Configuration Management position.

> [!CAUTION]
> Neither the minimum or potential activities outlined in this article are aligned to specific corporate policies or third party compliance requirements. This guidance is designed to help facilitate the conversations that will lead to alignment of both requirements with a Cloud Governance Model.
