# Fusion: How can a company add Resource Management discipline to their Cloud Governance execution?

In the [Intro to Cloud Governance](../overview.md), Resource Management is one of the Five Disciplines to Cloud Governance. This discipline focuses on ways of establishing policies related to the operational management of an environment, application, or workload. Within the Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance, Resource management includes monitoring of application, workload, and asset performance. It also includes the tasks required to meet scale demands, remediate performance SLA violations, and proactively avoid performance SLA violations through automated remediation.

This article outlines different phases of Resource Management evolution, as a company goes through increments of Planning, Building, Adopting, and Operating a cloud solution. It is impossible for any document collection to account for the various requirements of any business. As such, each section outlines a minimum suggested activity and a number of potential activities. The objective of each set of activities is to help build a [Policy MVP](../policy-compliance/overview.md), but establish a framework for [Incremental Policy](../policy-compliance/overview.md) evolution. The Cloud Governance Team should decide how much to invest in the potential activities to improve the Resource Management position.

> [!CAUTION]
> Neither the minimum suggested activities, nor the potential activities, outlined in this article are aligned to individual corporate policies or 3rd party compliance requirements. This guidance is designed to help facilitate the conversations that will lead to alignment of both requirements with a Cloud Governance Model.

## Planning & Readiness

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Plan process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/plan.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum Suggested Activities**

* Evaluate [Tool Chain](toolchain.md) options
* Develop and surface a draft of Architecture Guidelines
* Educate and involve the teams impacted in the development of Architecture Guidelines

**Potential Activities**

## Build / Pre-Deployment

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Build process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/build.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum Suggested Activities**

* Implement [Tool Chain](toolchain.md)
* Update Architecture Guidelines
* Educate teams impacted in the Architecture Guidelines

**Potential Activities**

## Adopt / Migrate

While not directly aligned, this phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Migrate process](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/migrate.md) for the [Operational Transformation Journey](../../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Minimum Suggested Activities**

* Adjust [Tool Chain](toolchain.md)
* Adjust Architecture Guidelines
* Educate teams impacted in the Architecture Guidelines

**Potential Activities**

## Operate / Post-Implementation

Once the transformation is complete, governance and operations must live on for the natural lifecycle of an  application or workload. This phase of governance maturity focuses on the activities that commonly come after the solution is implemented and the transformation cycle begins to stabilize.

**Minimum Suggested Activities**

* Customize [Tool Chain](toolchain.md)
* Automate [Tool Chain](toolchain.md)
* Refine Architecture Guidelines to guide future adoption processes
* Re-Educate impacted teams on a periodic basis to ensure on-going adherence to Architecture Guidelines

**Potential Activities**

Now that you understand the concept of cloud resource governance, move on to learn more about [how resource access is managed](azure-resource-access.md) in Azure in preparation for learning how to design a governance model for a [single team](governance-single-team.md) or [multiple teams](governance-multiple-teams.md).
