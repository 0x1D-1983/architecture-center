# Fusion: What is cloud governance?

In the Fusion framework, governance specifically focuses on actionable governance practices, including policies, enforcement, and management (cost, security, resource, identity, and configuration). Each of these facets is vital to ensure that cloud adoption is safely governed.

**Governance strategy** The cloud offers a variety of management tools. You can use these tools to automate and define action-based policies. A healthy governance strategy starts with an [understanding of business risks](policy-compliance/understanding-business-risk.md). Then you enact [policies](policy-compliance/overview.md) to create barriers that help mitigate those risks. Once policy is established, [monitoring and enforcement](monitoring-enforcement/overview.md) provides additional guidelines that define how policy is enforced and what happens when a deviation to policy occurs.

In some industry verticals, [regulatory compliance](policy-compliance/what-is-regulatory-compliance.md) supercedes corporate policy, and therefore requires a set of stricter guidelines. These enforceable yet flexible policies are the basis of any mature governance strategy. When policies accurately reflect tangible risks and the business' tolerance for risk, and not technical dogma, you can more easily adapt policy and resulting strategy to align with the cloud or any other technical deployment.

**Governance execution** The Cloud Governance Model focuses on the five disciplines of cloud governance, and each implements a different aspect of corporate policies to support safe cloud adoption. These disciplines include [cost management](cost-management/overview.md), [security management](security-management/overview.md), [identity management](identity-management/overview.md), [resource management](resource-management/overview.md), and [configuration management](configuration-management/overview.md). When policy focuses on risk and tolerance, the management disciplines can extend policy by applying proper risk mitigation to the chosen [deployment model](../getting-started/cloud-deployment-models.md).

## Adoption phases of the Cloud Governance Model

The objective of each adoption phase in the Cloud Governance Model is to help build a [Policy MVP](policy-compliance/overview.md#policy-minimally-viable-product-mvp) and establish a framework for [Incremental Policy evolution](policy-compliance/overview.md). The Cloud Governance Team should decide how much to invest in the potential activities to improve each of the five cloud governance disciplines.

While not directly aligned, each phase of governance maturity most closely maps to the activities outlined in the [Operational Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md).

**Planning and readiness** This process bridges the divide between business outcomes and actionable strategies. During this process, the leadership team defines specific metrics, maps those metrics to the digital estate, and begins planning the overall migration effort.

**Build and pre-deployment** A number of technical and non-technical pre-requisites are required to successful migrate an environment. This process focuses on the decisions, readiness, and core infrastructure that proceeds a migration.

**Adopt and migrate** Migration is an incremental process that focuses on the movement, testing, and adoption of applications or workloads in an existing digital estate.

**Post-implementation** Once the transformation is complete, governance and operations must live on for the natural lifecycle of an application or workload. This phase of governance maturity focuses on the activities that commonly come after the solution is implemented and the transformation cycle begins to stabilize.

## Next steps

The first step to taking action for any governance strategy is conducting a [policy review](policy-compliance/what-is-a-cloud-policy-review.md). [Policy and compliance](policy-compliance/overview.md) is a useful guide for you to reference during policy review. To prepare for a policy review, see the [guide to cloud readiness for chief information security officers (CISOs)](how-can-a-ciso-prepare-for-the-cloud.md).
