# Fusion: Cost Management Discipline

Cost Management is one of the five disciplines of [cloud governance](../overview.md). This discipline focuses on mitigating risks related to the cost of the cloud.

## Why is cost management relevant?

Cloud adoption creates a paradigm shift when it comes to cost governance. Management of cost in a traditional on-prem world is based on refresh cycles, data center acquisitions, host renewals, or recurring maintenance. Each of these costs can be forecasted, planned, and refined to align with annual Capital Expenditure budgets.

In the cloud, customers tend to take a more re-active approach to cost management. In many cases, the customer will pre-purchase, or commit to use, a set amount of cloud services. This model maximizes discounts based on how much of the customer plans to spend with the specific cloud vendor. This creates the perception of a proactive, planned cost cycle. However, that perception is only reality, if mature cost management disciplines are in place.

The cloud offers self-service capabilities that were unheard of in traditional on-prem datacenters. Those new capabilities empower the business to be more agile, less restrictive, and more open to adopt new technologies. However, the downside of self-service is that end users can unknowingly exceed allocated budgets. Conversely, the same users could experience a change in plans and unexpectedly not use the amount of cloud services forecasted. The potential of shift in either direction prompts many IT organizations to execute a cost management discipline within the governance team.

## Business Risk

The cost management discipline attempts to address the following business risks. During cloud adoption, monitor each of the following for relevance:

## Next steps

After establishing risk, tolerance, processes, and corporate policy, it's time to implement a cost management discipline.

Each of the policies above reference a cloud service that can be used to implement the policy. For additional tooling references, see the [Azure Specific Toolchain](toolchain.md).

To accelerate adoption of this discipline, see the list of [Azure Design Guides](../design-guides/overview.md). Find one that most closely aligns. Then modify that design to incorporate specific corporate policy decisions.
