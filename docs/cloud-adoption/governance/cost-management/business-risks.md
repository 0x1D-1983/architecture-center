# Fusion: Motivations and business risks that drive cost governance

This article outline the reasons customer typical adopt a cost management discipline within a cloud governance strategy. It also provides a few examples of business risks which drive policy statements.

## Is cost management relevant?

Cloud adoption creates a paradigm shift when it comes to cost governance. Management of cost in a traditional on-prem world is based on refresh cycles, data center acquisitions, host renewals, or recurring maintenance. Each of these costs can be forecasted, planned, and refined to align with annual Capital Expenditure budgets.

In the cloud, customers tend to take a more re-active approach to cost management. In many cases, the customer will pre-purchase, or commit to use, a set amount of cloud services. This model maximizes discounts based on how much of the customer plans to spend with the specific cloud vendor. This creates the perception of a proactive, planned cost cycle. However, that perception is only reality, if mature cost management disciplines are in place.

The cloud offers self-service capabilities that were unheard of in traditional on-prem datacenters. Those new capabilities empower the business to be more agile, less restrictive, and more open to adopt new technologies. However, the downside of self-service is that end users can unknowingly exceed allocated budgets. Conversely, the same users could experience a change in plans and unexpectedly not use the amount of cloud services forecasted. The potential of shift in either direction prompts for a cost management discipline within the governance team. The remainder of this article will discuss corporate policies and manual processes that can protect against misaligned cost forecasts.

## Business Risk

The cost management discipline attempts to address the following business risks. During cloud adoption, monitor each of the following for relevance:

* Budget Control: Not controlling budget could lead to excessive spending with a cloud vendor
* Utilization Loss: Pre-purchases or pre-commits that are not used could result in wasted investments
* Spend Anomalies: Unexpected spikes in either direction could be indicators of improper usage
* Over provisioned Assets: When assets are deployed in a configuration that exceeds the needs of an application or vm, it increases costs and creates waste.

## Next steps

Using the [Cloud Management Template](./template.md), document business risks that are likely to be introduced by the current cloud adoption plan.

Once an understanding of realistic business risks is established, the next step is to document the business's [tolerance for risk](./metrics-tolerance.md) and the indicators / key metrics to monitor that tolerance.
