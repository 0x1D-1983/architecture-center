# Fusion: Defining policy

Once you've analyzed the known risks and related risk tolerances for your organization's cloud transformation journey, your next step is to establish policy that will explicitly address those risks and define the steps needed to mitigate them where possible.

## How can corporate IT policy become cloud-ready?

Cloud governance is the product of an ongoing adoption effort over time, as a true lasting transformation doesn't happen overnight. Attempting to deliver complete cloud governance before addressing key corporate policy changes using a fast aggressive method seldom produces the desired results. Instead we recommend an incremental governance model. 

What is different about our cloud adoption framework is the buying cycle and the impact of that how that cycle can enable authentic transformation. Since there is not a big Capital Expenditure (CapEx) acquisition requirement, engineers can begin experimentation and adoption sooner. In most corporate cultures, elimination of the CapEx barrier to adoption can lead to tighter feedback loops, organic growth, and incremental execution.

The shift to cloud adoption requires a shift in governance. In many organizations, corporate policy transformation allows for improved governance and higher rates of adherence through incremental policy changes and automated enforcement of those changes, powered by newly defined capabilities that you configure with your cloud service provider. 

## Cloud policy definitions

Cloud-based IT policies establish the requirements, standards, and goals that your IT staff and automated systems will need to support. Policy decisions are a primary factor in your [cloud architecture design](architecture-design-guides.md) and how you will implement your [monitoring and enforcement](monitor-enforce.md) mechanisms. 
<!--- explain difference between policy documents and cloud policy definitions in this context--->
Individual cloud policy definitions are guidelines for addressing individual issues identified during your risk assessment process. Each definition should include these pieces of information:

* Business risk - A summary of the risk this policy will address.
* Policy statement - A concise explanation of the policy requirements and goals.
* Design guidance - Actionable recommendations, specifications, or other guidance to support and enforce this policy that IT teams and developers can use when designing and building their cloud deployments.

If you need help getting started with defining policies, consult the [governance disciplines](../overview.md#disciplines-of-cloud-governance) introduced in the governance section overview. The articles for each of these disciplines includes examples of common business risks encountered when moving to the cloud and sample policies used to mitigate those risks.

## Integrating with existing policy

If your organization already has existing policies governing your on-premises IT environment, your cloud governance policies should complement them where possible. At a high level many of the business risks you see in the cloud are the same as you would face on-premises, and the policies targeting those risks would also be the same. For instance, issues like security, access control, or disaster recover are common to cloud and on-premises environments. However, the details of how these issues are addressed in the cloud may differ significantly to how they have been handled by your IT department previously.

Performing a thorough [cloud policy review](what-is-a-cloud-policy-review.md) as part of your planning process is an important part ensuring your organization is extending your existing policy requirements to the cloud. Make sure to identify what policies are common across your entire IT estate, as well as what unique cloud-based issues may need to be addressed.

## Incremental policy updates

As your cloud deployment matures and the amount of your IT estate moving to the cloud increases, your risks and associated policy needs will also change. Governance is an ongoing process, and policy statements should be regularly reviewed with IT staff and stakeholders to ensure resources hosted in the cloud continue to maintain compliance with overall corporate goals and requirements.

Planned additions to your cloud environment should always be vetted for compliance with existing policy, and policy updated to account for any issues not already covered. You should also perform regular cloud policy reviews to keep cloud policy in-sync with the latest overall corporate policy. 

## Next steps

After defining your policies, [draft an architecture design guide](architecture-design-guides.md) to provide IT staff and developers with actionable guidance.
