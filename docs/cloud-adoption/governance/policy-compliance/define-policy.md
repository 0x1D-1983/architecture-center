# Fusion: Defining policy

Once you've analyzed the known risks and related risk tolerances for your organization's cloud transformation journey, your next step is to establish policy that will explicitly address those risks and define the steps needed to mitigate them where possible.

## Policy statements

Cloud-based IT policies establish the requirements, standards, and goals that your IT staff and automated systems will need to support. Policy decisions are a primary factor in your [cloud architecture design](architecture-design-guides.md) and how you will implement your [monitoring and enforcement](monitor-enforce.md) mechanisms. 

Individual policy statements are guidelines for addressing individual issues identified during your risk assessment process. Each statement should include these components:

* Policy overview - What is the purpose of the policy? What risk or goal is it addressing?
* Policy scope - What resources or systems are affected by this policy? What stakeholders are involved in defining the policy?  What teams will be responsible for complying with or enforcing the policy?
* Policy details - High level definition of the rules, processes, and enforcement requirements used to mitigate risk or otherwise achieve the policy's goal.

If you need help getting started with defining policies, consult the [governance disciplines](../overview.md#disciplines-of-cloud-governance) introduced in the governance section overview. The articles for each of these disciplines includes examples of common business risks encountered when moving to the cloud and the policies used to mitigate those risks.

## Integrating with existing policy

If your organization already has existing policies governing your on-premises IT environment, your cloud governance policies should complement them where possible. At a high level many of the business risks you see in the cloud are the same as you would face on-premises, and the policies targeting those risks would also be the same. For instance, issues like security, access control, or disaster recover are common to cloud and on-premises environments. However, the details of how these issues are addressed in the cloud may differ significantly to how they have been handled by your IT department previously.

Performing a thorough [cloud policy review](what-is-a-cloud-policy-review.md) as part of your planning process is an important part ensuring your organization is extending your existing policy requirements to the cloud. Make sure to identify what policies are common across your entire IT estate, as well as what unique cloud-based issues may need to be addressed.

## Incremental policy updates

As your cloud deployment matures and the amount of your IT estate moving to the cloud increases, your risks and associated policy needs will also change. Governance is an ongoing process, and policy statements should be regularly reviewed with IT staff and stakeholders to ensure resources hosted in the cloud continue to maintain compliance with overall corporate goals and requirements.

Planned additions to your cloud environment should always be vetted for compliance with existing policy, and policy updated to account for any issues not already covered. You should also perform regular cloud policy reviews to keep cloud policy in-sync with the latest overall corporate policy. 

## Next steps

After defining your policies, [draft an architecture design guide](architecture-design-guides.md) to provide IT staff and developers with actionable guidance.
