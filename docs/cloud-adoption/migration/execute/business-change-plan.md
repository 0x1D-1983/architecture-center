# Fusion: Why do we need a Business Change Plan

The [Migration section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a DataCenter to the cloud. This article, expands on the [Migration Execution Process](overview.md) by reviewing activities associated with the creation and execution of a Business Change Plan for a release.
  
Traditionally Information Technology (IT) has overseen the release of new applications or workloads. During a major transformation like a DataCenter migration, or a Cloud Migration, a similar pattern of IT lead adoption has historically been taken. When change is minimized and transformation is narrowed to a technology only view, this is possible. However, for any form of broad reaching digital transformation, a more holistic approach tends to be me impactful.

User Adoption Plans focus on how users will adopt a new technology or change to a given technology. This approach is time tested for introducing users to new tools. However, this approach often hits a glass ceiling which produces limited results in the business. When measurable and impactful business change is desire the plans need to expand from simply User Adoption to Business Change. Much like the approach to Business Testing (as opposed to User Acceptance Testing or UAT), Business Change Plans are a business activity that can be facilitated by IT. This article will outline the essentials of a Business Change Plan and a few approaches to guided facilitation of Business Change Planning.






User Adoption isn't enough. A business change plan is required to drive transformation.
How will this release improve the business? Who needs to be aware of that expectation?
How will the change be monitored & metriced?

Has the business been notified? Are all users trained? Are there any critical events/dates for the business that should be blacked out from change processes? 

What is the plan for minimizing business disruption? Is downtime expected? Has a downtime window been communicated to end users?

## Next steps

Once User Adoption Planning is complete, [Production Readiness activities](ready.md) can begin.
