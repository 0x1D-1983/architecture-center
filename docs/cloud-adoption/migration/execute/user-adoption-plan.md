# Fusion: Guidance to developing a business change plan

The [Migration section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a datacenter to the cloud. This article, expands on the [Migration Execution Process](overview.md)by reviewing activities associated with User Adoption Planning within a given release.

Coming Soon...

User Adoption isn't enough. A business change plan is required to drive transformation.
How will this release improve the business? Who needs to be aware of that expectation?
How will the change be monitored & metriced?

Has the business been notified? Are all users trained? Are there any critical events/dates for the business that should be blacked out from change processes? 

What is the plan for minimizing business disruption? Is downtime expected? Has a downtime window been communicated to end users?

## Next steps

Once User Adoption Planning is complete, [Production Readiness activities](ready.md) can begin.
