# Fusion: Guidance to Business Testing (UAT Testing) during to migration

The [Migration section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), outlines the processes typically required to migrate a DataCenter to the cloud. This article, expands on the [Migration Execution Process](overview.md)by reviewing activities associated with Business Testing within a given release.
  
Traditionally seen as an IT function, User Acceptance Testing during a business transformation is often most impactfully executed as a business function. IT then supports this business activity by facilitating the testing, developing testing plans, and automating tests when possible. While IT can often serve as a surrogate for testing, there is no replacement for first hand observation of real users attempting to leverage a new solution in the context of a real or replicated business process.
