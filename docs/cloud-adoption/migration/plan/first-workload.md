# Fusion: What's different about the first workload?

The article on [Incremental Rationalization](../../digital-estate/rationalize-inventory.md) discusses the value of the first workload relative to discovery, rationalization, and planning. In this article we discuss the value of the first workload from a technical perspective.

The first workload is different than any other workload because it creates the first opportunity test learnings. Prior to the deployment of the first workload, all cloud conversations are hypothetical. The first workload, is where the proverbial rubber meets the road. Once this workload is deployed all prior investments in cloud training are tested and validated. 

Speed to the successful deployment of the first workload is one of the most powerful indicators of success in a Cloud Transformation. Once cloud provider options are narrowed down to one or two vendors, first workload deployment should be measured in days or weeks. Delays that push this workload out to months are strong indicators of cultural, technical, or organizational risk.

## Learning opportunities

The first workload create a number of learning opportunities. The following are few that the team should be looking for during and after deployment:

* Planning and analysis validation: When the first workload goes live, the Cloud Strategy Team can observe end user responses to validate plans and qualitative analysis processes.
* Deployment model validation: The first workload allows the Cloud Adoption Team validation technologies used to deploy the workload.
* Pricing Validation: Once the workload is deployed, assets will likely require resizing to meeting performance expectations. The before and after sizing can aid in adjusting sizing and costing estimates.
* Network Validation: Access of the workload can expose network deficits or limitations in the Wide Area Network (WAN) used to access the cloud network. Resolution of these deficits can delay transformation by weeks even months.
* Skill deficits: It is unlikely the team has organically amassed all of the skills needed to be proficient in cloud migration activities. The first workload will help the team expose these deficits and obtain early training to overcome the deficits quickly.
* Operations Impacts: IT Operations is often the most heavily impacted by Cloud Transformations. New skills, tools, and processes may be required to achieve operational readiness. Generally IT Ops team struggle with requests to prepare for hypothetical scenarios. Once a workload is running in a staging environment, the Ops Team has something tangible to test and prepare for.
* Disaster Readiness: It is very common for plans to omit DR/BC or SLA requirements. Deploying and failing a first workload can validate plans and cost estimates to ensure these important aspects have been properly accounted for.

## Cultural Readiness

Moving quickly to the first workload demonstrates commitment and inspires the Cloud Adoption Team to adopt a Growth Mindset. Speed in adopting the first workload sets a tone for the remainder of the remainder of the Transformation Journey. The greatest impact IT leadership can have in the planning cycle, is a push to get the team to the first workload, with a sincere interest in collecting the learnings from the expected shortcoming of the first workload.

Individuals who are resistent to the first workload deployment are likely to be resistent to transformation throughout the process. It also identifies fiefdoms, silos, and guarded mindsets that are resistent to the types of change seen in a business or Cloud Transformation. Identifying these types of cultural roadblocks early is crucial. It provides an opportunity to retrain people on adoption of a growth mindset.

## Business Partnership

When the business knows that they are part of a revolutionary experiment, they tend to be move forgiving of errors and issues. Use the first workload as an opportunity to get the business excited. Prepare them for the unavoidable issues, but make them part of the experience. Inviting users into the early tests will create negative feedback, but it will also motivate and prepare them for the long journey ahead. Overcoming the bus/tech divide in the very first workload demonstrates transparency and partnership that should outweigh any negative feedback.
