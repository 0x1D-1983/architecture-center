# Cloud migration complexity checklist

The following checklist outlines the areas of complexity addressed by this guide.

- Balancing the portfolio
- Migrating at scale - High volume or velocity of migrations
- Business justification
- Multiple geographical regions
- Multiple data centers
- Governance or compliance strategy
- Technical complexity and change management
- Cultural complexity and change management
- Organizational complexity (Executive readiness)
- Organizational complexity (Skills readiness)
- Aligning support (Partner and other support options)

If any of these complexities align with the reader's scenario, then this section of the Cloud Adoption Framework will likely be a good guide for execution during the migration process.

## Complexities explained

To aid in determining alignment with the complex scenarios, each scenario is summarized below.

- **Balancing the portfolio:** The cloud strategy team is interested in investing more heavily in migration or innovation. Often times a balance between the two priorities is the key to success. In this guide, the topic of balancing the cloud adoption portfolio is a common topic, addressed in each of the migrate processes.
- **Migrating at scale:** Migrations exceeding 2,000 assets are likely to run into constraints that require additional planning and a disciplined approach to execution. The Assess and Migrate processes are adjusted to account for scale complexity.
- **Business justification:** Cost and Total Cost of Ownership may not be enough to establish priorities and justification with the business. During the Assess process, options and guidance for creating a balanced business justification is discussed.
- **Multiple geographical regions:** The business operates in multiple geographic regions with disparate data sovereignty requirements. To meet those requirements, additional considerations should be factored into the pre-requisite review and distribution of assets during migration.
- **Multiple data centers:** Migration of multiple data centers adds a great deal of complexity. During Assess, Migrate, Optimization, and Manage processes, additional considerations will be discussed.
- **Governance or compliance strategy:** When governance and compliance are vital to the success of a migration, additional alignment between IT Governance teams and the Cloud Adoption team is required.
- **Technical complexity (Change management):** Technical complexity, technical debt, and interdependencies can create a great deal of complexity that should be addressed during the assess, migrate, and optimize processes
- Cultural complexity (Change management and approval processes)
- Organizational complexity (Executive readiness)
- Organizational complexity (Skills readiness)
- Aligning support (Partner and other support options)
