# Fusion: What is a Cloud Adoption Team?

The Cloud Adoption Team is the group that drives the technical change within a Cloud Transformation. This team is responsible for migrating assets to the cloud, evolving applications and experiences, and/or developing new data-driven products. Depending on the desired business outcome, this team could be comprised of any number of technical skills across IT and business analysis. This article will outline the structure and duties of a Cloud Adoption Team.

## Structure of a Cloud Adoption Team

Cloud Transformations can impact any number of technologies. Depending on the desired business outcomes, the skills needed on this team could include infrastructure admins, devops specialists, application developers, data scientists, or any host of skills. Before aligning a Cloud Adoption Team, it is advised that an organization align to a common theme or [Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/overview.md). Each of those journeys aligns a specific set of skills and roles best suited for the success of a given transformation.

Commonly, this team is a flat organization with direct interactions between the [Cloud Strategy Team](what-is-a-cloud-strategy-team.md) and Cloud Governance Team. Those interactions allow for fluid communication and the ability to unblock projects. In the early releases that direct interaction will be necessary, as the team will encounter technical and cultural blockers that require support from both teams. It is also advised that this team be largely self-organizing from a technical execution perspective. Inclusion of project management with deep experience in agile, scrum, or other iterative models is also highly encouraged.

Variations: In some organizations, the effort to adopt is too large for one team. In those cases, maintaining a flat org is difficult, possibly even counter productive. When this proves to be the case, the Cloud Adoption Team will commonly resemble more of a Center of Excellence. In this variation, the Cloud Adoption Team is hands on with execution, but also helps scale various skills to other teams. As skills spread throughout the technical side of the enterprise, a higher number of engineers can contribute to the transformation and adoption effort. This variation tends to ebb & flow across various releases, so it is still suggested that the Cloud Adoption Team remain as a single unit, but allow the tasks to change with the migration plan.

## Duties of a Cloud Adoption Team

The primary duty of a Cloud Adoption Team is to ensure technical completion of the adoption plan, in alignment with corporate policies and architecture guidelines. As mentioned above, this team also focuses on expanding the skills of other engineers. At times this team may also serve as an interface or guide to technical operations teams, helping mold existing practices and tools to support the cloud. It is not uncommon for the Cloud Adoption Team to include both full time employees and third-party consultants.

**Early Planning Tasks:**

* Execute the [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/overview.md)
* Develop a [prioritized migration backlog](../migration/plan/migration-backlog.md)
* Begin execution of the [first workload](../migration/plan/first-workload.md)

**On-going Monthly Tasks:**

* Oversee [change management processes](../migration/plan/iterative-change-management.md)
* Manage the [on-going backlog](../migration/plan/migration-backlog.md)
* Maintain/build [core infrastructure](../infrastructure/overview.md)
* Execute the [adoption or migration process](../migration/execute/overview.md)

## Cloud Adoption Team cadence

It is suggested that this team be dedicated to the effort full time. However, the technical work associated with some Cloud Transformation can become repetitive. It is equally advised that team members be rotated out of this team every 3-6 months to avoid employee satisfaction issues and maintain relevant skills.
