VDC is a term coined by Mark Ozur, Hatay Tuna, Callum Coffin, and Telmo Sampaio from the Azure Customer Advisory Team (AzureCAT), in the eBook "[Azure Virtual Datacenter](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-virtual-datacenter/)".

Virtual Datacenter is an approach for deploying your applications and workloads in a cloud-based architecture while preserving key aspects of your current IT governance while taking advantage of cloud computingâ€™s agility. The goal in implementing a VDC is to provide similar governance capabilities on large Azure deployments as you would have in a traditional datacenter. At the same time, the VDC model allows teams within your organization to deploy individual workloads with the agility and flexibility common to Azure solutions, while still adhering to central IT policies.

*Abstract view of the VDC model's hub and spoke structure*

The VDC expands upon the existing [hub-spoke networking model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) to provide connectivity between isolated workload networks and a centrally managed hub network. The hub environment controls traffic to and from the workloads and the on-premises environment and controls any access to workloads from the internet.

Governing your workloads requires integrating management processes, regulatory requirements, and security processes within a cloud environment. In support of governance requirements, the VDC model provides basic guidance on implementing an organization's separation of roles, responsibilities, and policies in the cloud.  

### VDC Assumptions

Embedded in the Azure Virtual Datacenter model is a core set of assumptions. If your cloud migration requirements align with these assumptions, VDC guidance and associated resources can significantly reduce the time required to build out a large Azure deployment compliant with your organizations governance policy. However, even if these assumptions don't match your specific deployment scenarios, the VDC approach provides a logical way of thinking about complex, interconnected cloud-based solutions.

These assumptions include:

- You will need to securely access cloud-based resources with your on-premises environment using [hybrid networking](../software-defined-networks/hybrid.md).
- Your cloud estate will contain large number of assets and may exceed the number of resources [allowed within a single subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits), or your subscription design aims to segment workloads into separate subscriptions based on security or accounting requirements. If your deployments can exist within a single subscription a VDC structure is likely unnecessary.
- You will need to support agile deployment of workloads in support of developer and operations teams, while maintaining common policy and governance compliance.
- You need a security model that allows central IT control over core services and security coupled with delegated control of workload resources.
- The data stored on your cloud deployment is sensitive and needs to be secured using [encryption](../encryption/overview.md) in transit and at rest. Public data does not benefit from encryption.
- Your on-premises identity services can be [federated with Azure Active Directory](../identity/overview.md#federation-vdc).
- Your workloads will be compatible with cloud-based authentication methods such as AML and oAuth/OpenID connect. Legacy authentication methods like Kerberos or NTLM are not incorporated in the VDC model by default and need to be provisioned separately. 

## Fusion framework infrastructure and VDC

The [Infrastructure section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), describes the components required to migrate core infrastructure services to Azure. VDC is built on these core services, and each of the following topics discuss how the VDC model uses these services to implement create a secure cloud network extension compliant with your organization's governance requirements: 

- [Subscription design and VDC](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md)
- [Identity and roles in VDC](../identity/vdc-identity.md)
- [Resource grouping in VDC](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md)
- [Azure Policy and VDC](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md)
- [VDC naming and tagging recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md)
- [VDC networking architecture](../software-defined-networks/vdc-networking.md)
- [Encryption in VDC](../encryption/vdc-encryption.md)
- [VDC reporting and monitoring](../logs-and-reporting/vdc-monitoring.md)

## Azure Virtual Datacenter structure

The core of the VDC model is the hub environment managed by central IT teams. This hub contains the infrastructure through which all network traffic flows, policies are set, and core monitoring occurs. It provides central security and networking services, including the hub virtual network that connects to other parts of the datacenter, and manages any external connections used by resources hosted outside the virtual datacenter.

Isolated workload environments host the various applications and services that business teams will use. Each workload environment has its own management resources and spoke virtual networking infrastructure. Central IT manages connectivity with between hub and spoke networks, and apply global policy and access control. However, workload teams can add additional policies to control access and resource usage within the spoke environment as long as they don't conflict with central policies.

![Sample VDC structure](../../_images/virtual-datacenter/sample-vdc-structure.png)

*Sample VDC structure, showing major components of hub and spoke environments.*

### Subscription design

The central hub environment and each workspace spoke are intended to be created in separate Azure subscriptions. This policy decision is intended to increase workload flexibility and avoid subscription-related limits. For example, workspace-level RBAC enables teams to deploy resources for specific workloads or projects. If some teams want to run more than one workload in their workspace, they can do so without needing another subscription. Enforcement of global organizational policies is maintained on all subscriptions.

> See the [subscription design and VDC](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md) topic for more details.

### Identity

The Azure Virtual Datacenter model requires a common Azure AD tenant [associated will all Azure subscriptions](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md#subscription-requirements) connected to the VDC. It's assumed that this tenant is [federated with your on-premises identity provider](../identity/vdc-identity.md) so that you can use a common set of users, groups, and roles across your organization.

The VDC model breaks down the central IT teams into [three primary roles](../identity/vdc-identity.md#roles-and-rbac): Security Operations (SecOps), Network Operations(NetOps), and System Operations(SysOps). To support centralized IT control over core security, policy, and networking features, and also to encourage separation of duties among IT staff, RBAC is used to assign these groups access to appropriate pieces of the VDC environment.

These central roles are responsible for managing the core hub infrastructure and other global security and operations tasks. Workload teams can also configure their own version of these roles with responsibilities limites to the workload spoke environment.

> See [Identity and roles in VDC](../identity/vdc-identity.md) topics for more details.

### Resource organization

Within subscriptions, the [VDC model organizes resource groups](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md) around functionality, and provides [tagging and naming recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md) to support efficient operational management of VDC-hosted resources.

> See the [Resource grouping in VDC](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md) and [VDC naming and tagging recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md) topics for more details.

### Azure policy

[Azure Policy rules are applied](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md) at both the subscriptions and resource group level. These policy rules impose limitations on what resources can be created in what sections of the VDC, as well as enforcing encryption on all Azure Storage accounts hosted in the VDC.  

> See the [Azure Policy and VDC](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md) topic for more details

### Key vault

With policy rules enforcing encrypted storage on all VDC subscriptions, you need to securely host and store encryption keys before any storage or virtual machines can be deployed. The VDC model calls for provisioning a Key Vault instance for the hub environment and each of the workload subscriptions. After these key vaults are deployed, cryptographic keys are created and stored in Key Vault, which are then used to perform storage encryption tasks. An encrypted storage account should also be created in the Key Vault resource group for storing audit log information related to the vault itself.

Access to modify secrets and keys within the vault is restricted to the central IT SecOps teams for the hub key vault, while workload key vaults can be accessed by users with the appropriate security role within the workload spoke environment. Other roles can use secrets and keys to encrypt and decrypt storage and access encrypted virtual machines, but they cannot modify or otherwise access any keys.

> See the [Encryption in VDC](../encryption/vdc-encryption.md) topic for more details.

### Networking

The central hub and multiple workload spokes are deployed as separate virtual networks in the VDC model, each residing in their respective subscription. Virtual network peering provides basic connectivity between the central IT hub and workspace spoke virtual networks. If a workload goes out of compliance, central IT can immediately sever the peering connection, effectively cutting off all resources in the affected workspace from the wider virtual datacenter.

The hub network hosts both the on-premises connectivity and the central firewall capabilities that manage traffic going to and from the workload spokes. It also hosts secure bastion jump boxes used for management of the hub environment, and hosts any common shared services that workloads can take advantage of (for instance,  DNS servers).

Connectivity between your on-premises environment and the hub virtual network is provided through either an [ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [Azure VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). 

The VDC model supports connecting hub and spoke networks across geo-regions. However, connecting between geo-regions has the potential to introduce higher latency than would be the case if all networks were in the same geo-region, and this potential latency would need to be accounted for in your network and workload planning.

> See the [VDC networking architecture](../software-defined-networks/vdc-networking.md) topic for more details.

### Monitoring and compliance

The VDC model uses [Azure Monitor]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)) as the default monitoring and reporting service. Azure Monitor's Log Analytics feature allows you to capture log data related to virtual machines and your network environment. When deploying a VDC, a Log Analytics instance is created for the central IT hub and each of the workload spokes, which then allows you to configure reports and alerts for your deployed resources.

Built in Azure features such as  [Azure Active Directory Reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-reports), [Azure Network Watcher (NW)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/), and [Azure Security Center (ASC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/)are also a core monitoring component of the VDC model.

> See the [VDC reporting and monitoring](../logs-and-reporting/vdc-monitoring.md) topic for more details.

### Hub components

The hub subscription contains the core networking, external connectivity, and platform services enabling central management of the VDC. These resources are organized along functional sections, which is reflected in the recommended VDC [resource grouping strategy](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md). The VDC model recommends deploying resources to the hub environment in the following order:  

| Section          | Resources                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operations       | <ul><li>Log Analytics instance: responsible for logging VM and network activity in the hub environment and integration with Azure Monitor.</li></ul> |
| Key Vault        | <ul><li>Key Vault instance: used to store keys and secrets used when encrypting resources in the hub or other sections of the VDC under direct central IT control. </li><li>KV diagnostic storage account: encrypted storage account used to record audit information related to key vault access and activity.</li></ul> |

| Management       | <ul><li>Management VMs: contains the secure bastion host used for management access to resources hosted on the hub network. </li><li>Management diagnostic storage account: encrypted storage account used to store log data related to management VMs.</li></ul> |
| Shared services  | <ul><li>Shared services servers: VMs providing services, such as DNS, used across the hub and spoke networks. </li><li>Network diagnostic storage account: encrypted storage account used to store log data related to shared services VMs.</li></ul> |

### Spoke Components

As with the hub subscription, each spoke subscription requires a standard set of operations, key vault, and networking resources. These resources should be deployed in the following order:

| Section          | Resources                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operations       | <ul><li>Log Analytics instance: responsible for logging VM and network activity in the spoke environment and integration with Azure Monitor.</li></ul> |
| Key Vault        | <ul><li>Key Vault instance: used to store keys and secrets used when encrypting resources in the workload spoke. </li><li>KV diagnostic storage account: encrypted storage account used to record audit information related to key vault access and activity.</li></ul> |
| Networking       | <ul><li>Spoke virtual network: contains a default subnet and base network configuration used by the spoke network. Uses virtual network peering to connect with (and only with) the hub network. </li><li>Spoke NSG: Network security group containing network access and security rules applied to the default subnet through which traffic will pass between on-premises and spokes.</li><li>Spoke UDR: User Defined Route table containing routing rules for in the default subnet which routes all traffic leaving the spoke network to the hub networks primary subnet for processing by the VDC central firewall.</li><li>Network diagnostic storage account: encrypted storage account used to store log data related to networking activity on the spoke network.</li></ul> |
| Workload         | After the core spoke components are in place and configured, workload teams can deploy resources they need to the spoke environment.  |
