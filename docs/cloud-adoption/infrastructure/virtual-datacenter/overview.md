# Fusion: Azure Virtual Datacenter (VDC) Model

This section of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md) guides you through the process and associated considerations when deploying workloads to Azure using the Azure Virtual Datacenter (VDC) model.

Jump to: 

VDC is a term coined by Mark Ozur, Hatay Tuna, Callum Coffin, and Telmo Sampaio from the Azure Customer Advisory Team (AzureCAT), in the eBook "[Azure Virtual Datacenter](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/azure-virtual-datacenter/)".

Virtual Datacenter is an approach for deploying your applications and workloads in a cloud-based architecture while preserving key aspects of your current IT governance and taking advantage of cloud computingâ€™s agility. The goal in implementing a VDC is to provide similar governance capabilities on large Azure deployments as you would have in a traditional datacenter. At the same time, the VDC model allows teams within your organization to deploy individual workloads with the agility and flexibility common to Azure solutions, while still adhering to central IT policies.

*Abstract view of the VDC model's hub and spoke structure*

The VDC expands upon the existing [hub-spoke networking model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke) to provide connectivity between isolated workload networks and a centrally managed hub network. The hub environment controls traffic to and from the workloads and the on-premises environment and controls any access to workloads from the internet.

Governing your workloads requires integrating management processes, regulatory requirements, and security processes within a cloud environment. In support of governance requirements, the VDC model provides basic guidance on implementing an organization's separation of roles, responsibilities, and policies in the cloud.  

### VDC Assumptions

Embedded in the Azure Virtual Datacenter model is a core set of assumptions. If your cloud migration requirements align with these assumptions, VDC guidance and associated resources can significantly reduce the time required to build out a large Azure deployment compliant with your organizations governance policy. However, even if these assumptions don't match your specific deployment scenarios, the VDC approach provides a logical way of thinking about complex, interconnected cloud-based solutions.

These assumptions include:

- You will need to securely access cloud-based resources with your on-premises environment using [hybrid networking](../software-defined-networks/hybrid.md).
- Your cloud estate will contain large number of assets and may exceed the number of resources [allowed within a single subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits), or your subscription design aims to segment workloads into separate subscriptions based on security or accounting requirements. If your deployments can exist within a single subscription a VDC structure is likely unnecessary.
- The data stored on your cloud deployment is sensitive and needs to be secured using [encryption](../encryption/overview.md) in transit and at rest. Public data does not benefit from encryption.
- Your on-premises identity services are compatible with Azure AD-based [identity federation](../identity/overview.md#federation-vdc).
- Your workloads will be compatible with cloud-based authentication methods such as AML and oAuth/OpenID connect. Legacy authentication methods like Kerberos or NTLM are not incorporated in the VDC model by default and need to be provisioned separately. 

## Fusion framework infrastructure and VDC

The [Infrastructure section](../overview.md) of the [Fusion framework](../../overview.md), describes the components required to migrate core infrastructure services to Azure. VDC is built on these core services, and each of the following topics discuss how the VDC model uses these services to implement create a secure cloud network extension compliant with your organization's governance requirements: 

- [Subscription design and VDC](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md)
- [Identity and roles in VDC](../identity/vdc-identity.md)
- [Resource grouping in VDC](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md)
- [Azure Policy and VDC](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md)
- [VDC naming and tagging recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md)
- [VDC networking architecture](../software-defined-networks/vdc-networking.md)
- [Encryption in VDC](../encryption/vdc-encryption.md)
- [VDC reporting, monitoring and compliance](../logs-and-reporting/vdc-monitoring.md)

## Azure Virtual Datacenter structure

The core of the VDC model is the hub environment managed by central IT teams. This hub contains the infrastructure through which all network traffic flows, policies are set, and core monitoring occurs. It provides central security and networking services, including the hub virtual network that connects to other parts of the datacenter, and manages any external connections used by resources hosted outside the virtual datacenter.

Isolated workload environments host the various applications and services that business teams will use. Each workload environment has its own management resources and spoke virtual networking infrastructure. Central IT manages connectivity with between hub and spoke networks, and apply global policy and access control. However, workload teams can add additional policies to control access and resource usage within the spoke environment as long as they don't conflict with central policies.

### Subscription design

The central hub environment and each workspace spoke are intended to be created in separate Azure subscriptions. This policy decision is intended to increase workload flexibility and avoid subscription-related limits. For example, workspace-level RBAC enables teams to deploy resources for specific workloads or projects. If some teams want to run more than one workload in their workspace, they can do so without needing another subscription. Enforcement of global organizational policies is maintained on all subscriptions.

> See the [subscription design and VDC](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md) topic for more details.

### Identity

The Azure Virtual Datacenter model requires a common Azure AD tenant [associated will all Azure subscriptions](../subscriptions/vdc-subscriptions.md#subscription-requirements) connected to the VDC. It's assumed that this tenant is [federated with your on-premises identity provider](../identity/vdc-identity.md) so that you can use a common set of users, groups, and roles across your organization.

The VDC model breaks down the central IT teams into [three primary roles](../identity/vdc-identity.md#roles-and-rbac): Security Operations (SecOps), Network Operations(NetOps), and System Operations(SysOps). To support centralized IT control over core security, policy, and networking features, and also to encourage separation of duties among IT staff, RBAC is used to assign these groups access to appropriate pieces of the VDC environment.

These central roles are responsible for managing the core hub infrastructure and other global security and operations tasks. Workload teams can also configure their own version of these roles with responsibilities limites to the workload spoke environment.

> See [Identity and roles in VDC](../identity/vdc-identity.md) topics for more details.

### Resource organization

Within subscriptions, the [VDC model organizes resource groups](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md) around functionality, and provides [tagging and naming recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md) to support efficient operational management of VDC-hosted resources.

> See the [Resource grouping in VDC](../resource-grouping/vdc-resource-grouping.md) and [VDC naming and tagging recommendations](../resource-tagging/vdc-naming.md) topics for more details.

### Azure policy

[Azure Policy rules are applied](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md) at both the subscriptions and resource group level. These policy rules impose limitations on what resources can be created in what sections of the VDC, as well as enforcing encryption on all Azure Storage accounts hosted in the VDC.  

> See the [Azure Policy and VDC](../policy-enforcement/vdc-policy-enforcement.md) topic for more details

### Key vault

With policy rules enforcing encrypted storage on all VDC subscriptions, you need to securely host and store encryption keys before any storage or virtual machines can be deployed. The VDC model calls for provisioning a Key Vault instance for each the hub environment and each of the workload subscriptions. After these key vaults are deployed, a cryptographic key is created and stored in Key Vault, which is then used to perform storage encryption tasks. An encrypted storage account should also be  created in the Key Vault resource group for storing audit log information related to the vault.

Edit access to secrets and keys within the vault is restricted to the central IT SecOps teams for the hub key vault, while workload key vaults can be accessed by users with the appropriate security role within the workload spoke environment. Other roles can use secrets and keys to encrypt and decrypt storage and access encrypted virtual machines, but they cannot modify or otherwise access any keys.

> See the [Encryption in VDC](../encryption/vdc-encryption.md) topic for more details.

### Networking

The central hub and multiple workload spokes are deployed as separate virtual networks in the VDC model, each residing in their respective subscription. Virtual network peering provides basic connectivity between the central IT hub and workspace spoke virtual networks. If a workload goes out of compliance, central IT can immediately sever the peering connection, effectively cutting off all resources in the affected workspace from the wider virtual datacenter.

The hub network hosts both the on-premises connectivity and the central firewall capabilities that manage traffic going to and from the workload spokes. It also hosts secure bastion jump boxes used for management of the hub environment, and hosts any common shared services that workloads can take advantage of (for instance,  DNS servers).

Connectivity between your on-premises environment and the hub virtual network is provided through either an [ExpressRoute circuit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction) or [Azure VPN gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways). 

> See the [VDC networking architecture](../software-defined-networks/vdc-networking.md) topic for more details.
