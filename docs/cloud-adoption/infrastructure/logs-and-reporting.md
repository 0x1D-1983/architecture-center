# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Logs, Reporting, and Monitoring

All organizations need mechanisms notifying IT teams of performance, uptime, and security
issues before they become serious problems. A successful monitoring strategy
allows you to understand how the individual components that make up your
workloads and networking infrastructure are performing. Within the context of a
public cloud migration, integrating logging and reporting with any of your
existing monitoring systems, while surfacing important events and metrics to the
appropriate IT staff, is critical in ensuring your organization is meeting
uptime, security, and policy compliance goals.

## Planning your monitoring infrastructure

When planning your deployment, you will need to consider where logging data is
stored and how you integrate cloud-based reporting and monitoring services with
your existing processes and tools.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Do you have existing on-premise monitoring infrastructure?                             | No           | Yes    | Yes         |
| Do you have requirements preventing storage of log data on external storage locations? | No           | No     | Yes         |
| Do you need to integrate cloud monitoring with on-premises systems?                    | No           | Yes    | No          |

### Cloud native

If your organization currently lacks established monitoring and reporting
systems, or if your planned cloud deployment does not need to be integrated with
existing on-premises or other external monitoring systems, a cloud native
solution is likely the simplest choice.

In this scenario log data is recorded and stored in the same cloud environment
as your workload, while the monitoring and reporting tools that process and
surface information to IT staff are offered as part of the could platform.

### Hybrid

You'll need to implement a hybrid monitoring system if you plan to integrate log
data from your new could deployment with systems living in your on-premises
environment.

In most hybrid monitoring systems, log data is stored in the cloud alongside
your cloud-based workloads. This data is then either accessed by on-premises
monitoring systems directly or through integration between the cloud-based
monitoring and reporting systems and your on-premises systems. Alternatively,
you can migrate to primarily using the cloud-based monitoring and reporting
systems, which imports log data recorded on-premises or on other external data
sources.

### On-premises

If you are required through regulatory or organizational policy to keep all log
data on-premises, you will need to provide a mechanism for cloud-based systems
to send data directly to on-premises storage locations, which can then be used
in your on-premises management systems. To save log data on-premises you will
need to either connect your on-premises and cloud networks or provide secure
services that cloud-hosted resources can communicate with over the internet.

## Reporting and monitoring in Azure

[Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview)
is the default reporting and monitoring service on Azure. It consists of several
tools capable of logging, visualizing, analyzing, and reporting on telemetry
data generated by Azure resources. It's capable of providing insights into
virtual machines, guest operating systems, virtual network, and workload
application events. It also provides import and export mechanisms for
integrating with on-premises or third-party systems.

### Log Analytics

[Azure Log
Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-queries)
is the component of Azure Monitor used to collect telemetry information from
virtual machines and guest operating systems hosted in the Azure cloud. The tool
also provides the mechanisms to analyze this data or created alerts. [In hybrid
scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-concept-hybrid),
on-premises or other externally hosted physical servers and virtual machines can
be configured to send telemetry to your azure-based Log Analytics instance for
integrated analysis and reporting.

### Application Insights

[Application
Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-overview?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json)
is the Azure Monitor component designed to capture telemetry data from
applications and workloads. Applications can include the Application Insights
SDK or the hosting web server can be configured to send telemetry without
requiring modification to application code.

### Azure Monitor Integration

Azure Monitor provides a [REST
API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-rest-api-walkthrough)
for integration with external services and automation of monitoring and alerting
services.

In addition, Azure Monitor offers [integration with may popular 3rd party
vendors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-partners).
