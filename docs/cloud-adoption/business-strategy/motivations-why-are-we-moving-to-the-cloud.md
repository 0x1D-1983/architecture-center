# Enterprise Cloud Adoption: Why are we moving to the cloud?

This is an extremely common question for business and technical stakeholders alike.
If the answer is "Our board (CIO, C-Suite) told us to move to the cloud", the likelihood of failure is through the roof before the first account is created.

In this article, we will discuss a few more valuable motivations behind cloud migration. These options are designed to help facilitate a more impactful conversation regarding motivations and ultimately business outcomes.

## Common Motivations for Cloud Transformation

The following is a list of common motivations for cloud transformation ranked from least to most impactful. 

* The C-Suite said to
* Critical Business Event
* Cost Savings
* Optimize internal operations
* Increase business agility
* Build new technical capabilities
* Scale to meet market demands
* Scale to meet geographic demands
* Improve customer experiences / engagements
* Transform products or services

There are technical strategies to execute against each of these motivations. However, the further down the list a specific motivation is, the more likely the business is to experience positive business outcomes as a result of the transformation efforts. This is expanded on in the next section on evolving the IT worldview.

## Evolving the IT worldview

**Traditional IT Operations Worldview** The first five motivations above are the most common (but not necessarily the most impactful) reasons for adopting the cloud. These motivations are signals that the IT organization aligns with the Traditional IT mindset. That mindset is largely internal focused. As a result, IT is viewed as a cost center or a means of hosting the technical assets the business is dependent on. As a cost center, the most common conversations center around agility, efficiencies, and cost reduction.

These are important outcomes to achieve, but are most effectively used as a means of transitioning to other more effective worldviews. IT organizations that help the business tackle Customer or Industry challenges can move from cost center to value creator. Efficiency in a vacuum produces diminishing returns & often inspires demands for greater efficiency or cost reduction. Efficiency combined with improvements to customer engagement or creation of new revenue streams, drive more impactful IT enabled business outcomes, as seen in the next two worldviews.

To help guide the strategies and execution of these traditional journeys, the Enterprise Cloud Adoption framework has built the [Operational Transformation Journey](../transformation-journeys/operational-transformation/overview.md) to help facilitate the decisions and interactions needed to execute effective strategies throughout this journey.

**Customer Obsessed Worldview** The next three motivations (Build new technical capabilities, scale to meet market & geographical demand, and improve customer experiences) are indicators of an outward facing worldview that is very customer centric. Incrementally evolving current solutions to meet the changing demands of customers is the defining difference. That focus moves IT a bit from the cost center mindset & into the first stage of transformation.

Coming Spring of 2019, the Incremental Transformation Journey will help guide execution in a customer focused, DevOps centric journey.

**Market Leader (Future Customer) Worldview** The last motivation (Transform products or services) speaks to a future looking view of IT. This approach seeks to align with the business to tackle much tougher questions. Transforming products and services requires a vision of the customer & the needs they will face in the future. Building new solutions that get ahead of current customers and tackle larger industry needs is the most common focus of IT organizations with this type of transformative view of the world.

Data is the new commodity... In today's business market, its hard to find a transformative product or service that isn't built on top of data & insights. IT orgs with an industry worldview tend to start with variety, velocity, and veracity data challenges. The transformation centers around an understanding for current and projected business challenges and the development of the capabilities required to address those future needs.

Coming Summer fo 2019, the Disruptive Transformation Journey will help guide execution of Industry focused, forward looking strategies.
