# Interactive Price Analytics 
The Pricing Analytics solution uses your transactional history data to show you how the demand for your products responds to the prices you offer, to recommend pricing changes, and allow you to simulate how changes in price would affect your demand, at a fine granularity.
The solution provides a dashboard, where you can see optimal pricing recommendations, item elasticities at a item-site-channel-segment level, estimates of related-product effects such "as cannibalization", forecasts given current process, and model perfomance metrics.
Direct interaction with the pricing model in Excel lets you simply paste your sales data there and analyze your prices without the need to integrate the data into the solution database first, simulate promotions and plot demand curves (showing demand response to price), and access dashboard data in numerical form.
The rich functionality is not confined to Excel. It is driven by web services that you, or your implementation partner, can call directly from your business applications, integrating price analysis into your business applications.
