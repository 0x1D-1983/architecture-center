# Oil and Gas Tank Level Forecasting 
Today, most facilities operate reactively to problems in tank levels. This often leads to spills, emergency shutdowns, expensive remediation costs, regulatory issues, costly repairs and fines. Tank level forecasting helps manage and abate these and other problems.
Forecasts are created by harnessing the power of real-time and historical data readily available from sensors, meters and records, which helps to:
The tank level forecasting process starts at the well input. Oil is measured as it comes into the facility via meters and is sent to tanks. Levels are monitored and recorded in tanks during the refining process and then oil, gas, and water output are recorded via sensors, meters, and records. Forecasts are then made using data from the facility; for example, forecasts can be made every 15 minutes.
The Cortana Intelligence Suite is adaptable and can be customized to meet different requirements that facilities and corporations have.
