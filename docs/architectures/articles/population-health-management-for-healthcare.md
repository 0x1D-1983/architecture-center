# Population Health Management for Healthcare

Population Health Management is an important tool that is increasingly being used by health care providers to manage and control the escalating costs. The crux of Population Health Management is to use data to improve health outcomes. Tracking, monitoring, and bench marking are the three bastions of Population Health Management, aimed at improving clinical and health outcomes while managing and reducing cost.
In this solution, we will be leveraging the clinical and socioeconomic in-patient data generated by hospitals for population health reporting. As an example of a machine learning application with population health management, a model is utilized to predict length of hospital stay. It is geared towards hospitals and health care providers to manage and control the health care expenditure through disease prevention and management. You can learn about the data used and the length of hospital stay model in the manual deployment guide for the solution. Hospitals can use these results to optimize care management systems and focus their clinical resources on patients with more urgent need. Understanding the communities they serve through population health reporting can help hospitals transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based care while reducing costs and providing better care.
