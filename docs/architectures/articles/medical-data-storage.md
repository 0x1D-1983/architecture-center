# Medical Data Storage Solutions 
Cloud and hybrid solutions from Microsoft help you manage medical data storage efficiently and cost effectively, while infusing intelligence and maintaining compliance.

## Architecture
<img src="media/medical-data-storage.svg" alt='architecture diagram' />

## Data Flow
1. Securely ingest medical image data using Azure Data Factory.
1. Securely store medical image data in Azure Data Lake Store and/or Azure Blob Storage.
1. Analyze medical image data using a pre-trained Azure Cognitive Services API or a custom developed Machine Learning model.
1. Store artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning results in Azure Data Lake.
1. Interact AI and Machine Learning results using PowerBI, while preserving Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
1. Securely interact with medical image data via a web based vendor neutral archive (VNA) image viewer.
